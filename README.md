The purpose of this project is to produce a Object-Oriented Design and demonstration Java program that simulates a smart light system with a controller, hub and smart light bulbs.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate your ability to do object-oriented design and then implement a demonstration of the quality of that design. The discussion that follows supplies some input necessary to create the object model but more discovery is likely necessary.
